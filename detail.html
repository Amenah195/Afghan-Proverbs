        <h2>Proverbs:</h2>
        <div class="gallery-item">
            <p class="proverb-text">هر چی در دیگ است،در ملاقه برآید</p>
            <p class="proverb-translation"><b>"Whatever is in the pot, will come out in the ladle."</b></p>
            <p class="proverb-translation"><strong>Explanation:</strong>This proverb means that a person's words or
                actions reveal what is inside them — their inner thoughts, feelings, or true nature.
                Just like a ladle scoops out what is actually in the pot, what someone says or does shows what they
                truly hold inside.

        <div class="gallery-item">
            <p class="proverb-text">آب را گل آلود میسازد که ماهی بگیرد .</p>
            <p class="proverb-translation"><b>"He muddies the water to catch fish."</b></p>
            <p class="proverb-translation"><strong>Explanation:</strong> This saying is used to describe someone who
                deliberately creates confusion, chaos, or disorder in order to take advantage of the situation or
                achieve personal gain.
                Just as fish are harder to see and easier to catch in muddy water, the person seeks to obscure clarity
                so they can manipulate the outcome without being noticed or opposed.
                It’s often used to criticize opportunistic or deceptive behavior, especially in politics, business, or
                interpersonal conflicts.</p>

        <div class="gallery-item">
            <p class="proverb-text">سگ که چاق شود، صاحب خوده نمیشناسد</p>
            <p class="proverb-translation"><b>"when a dog becmes fat,it doesn't recognize its owner."</b></p>
            <p class="proverb-translation"><strong>Explanation:</strong> This proverb is used to describe a person who,
                after gaining power, wealth, or success, becomes arrogant and forgets or disrespects the people who
                helped them or were close to them when they were less fortunate.
                It’s a warning against ingratitude and pride.</p>

        <div class="gallery-item">
            <p class="proverb-text">دیگ که دوتا جوش کند، شوربا بی مزه میشه</p>
            <p class="proverb-translation">
                <b">when a pot boils twice, the soup becomes tasteless."</b>
            </p>
            <p class="proverb-translation"><strong>Explanation:</strong> This saying means that when too many people
                interfere in a task or when there's a lack of unity in decision-making, the result will be
                unsatisfactory or ruined</p>

        <div class="gallery-item">
            <p class="proverb-text">مار گزیده از ریسمان سیاه و سفید میترسد</p>
            <p class="proverb-translation"><b>"A snake-bitten person is afraid of black and white rope."</b></p>
            <p class="proverb-translation"><strong>Explanation:</strong>This proverb refers to someone who has had a
                painful or traumatic experience, and as a result, they become overly cautious or fearful, even of things
                that are harmless but remind them of that bad experience.</p>

        <div class="gallery-item">
            <p class="proverb-text">باد آورده را باد می برد</p>
            <p class="proverb-translation"><b>"The wind has brought it,the wind will take it away."</b></p>
            <p class="proverb-translation"><strong>Explanation:</strong>This saying means that anything gained easily,
                without effort or hard work, can be lost just as easily. It emphasizes the importance of working for
                what you have and not relying on luck or easy gains.</p>
